## Overview

We know data validation up front saves a headache later. Nevertheless,
we sometimes find ourselves in situations where we donâ€™t have it. This
package addresses messy height and weight data. I also include a
function to check that observations fall within plausible values.

## Installation

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cecusack/clairecleans")
#> Skipping install of 'clairecleans' from a github remote, the SHA1 (b5d16dd0) has not changed since last install.
#>   Use `force = TRUE` to force installation
```

## Usage

Please see the vignette for demonstrations on how to use `fixheight`,
`fixweight`, and `check_measure`.
