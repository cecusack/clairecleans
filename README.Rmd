## Overview

We know data validation up front saves a headache later. Nevertheless, we sometimes find ourselves in situations where we don't have it. This package addresses messy height and weight data. I also include a function to check that observations fall within plausible values.

## Installation
```{r}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("cecusack/clairecleans")
```

## Usage

Please see the vignette for demonstrations on how to use `fixheight`, `fixweight`, and `check_measure`.
